### Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm
Python script that uses a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesperson problem. The script generates a random set of city coordinates, then uses a KD-tree for efficient nearest-neighbor search. It defines a mutation rate and number of iterations, and implements a fitness function to evaluate the quality of a solution. The script then creates an initial population of solutions and iteratively applies crossover and mutation to generate new solutions and evaluate their fitness. The best solution is plotted at each iteration using matplotlib.
